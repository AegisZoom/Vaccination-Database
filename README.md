# SQL Project: COVID-19 Vaccination Database

## ISYS1055: Database Concepts

### Grade: 97.5%

## Introduction

This repository contains my work for the fourth and final assessment for ISYS1055 in my Graduate Diploma of Data Science. This assessment was
split into four phases: the first required me to investigate the datasets provided and understand their meaning, data types and relationships.
The second phase required me to design a database that would adequately house all the data using good design principles. The third phase
required me to construct the database using SQLiteStudio and to load the transformed data into it successfully. The fourth and final phase
was where I constructed SQL queries to extract data based on requested specifications to perform data visualisations. This page will summarise the work I conducted beyond the
first phase.

## Skills Used

- 💾 **Programming**:
Used SQL 🌐 to construct a database and to extract data based on conditions. SQL programming was also used to perform statistical analyses of records. R 📉 was used as a programming language to transform and visualise the data.
- 🔨 **Database Design**: Constructed the database by firstly designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram, mapping the diagram to a relational schema, then finally performing normalisation procedures to streamline database design.
- 🎣 **SQL Query Extraction**: Performed complex SQL queries to extract data based on specifications while conducting complex statistical operations and presenting them in additional data columns.
- 📈 **Data Analysis**:
Performed statistical operations using SQL queries. Constructed data visualisations to summarise trends in data.
- 📊 **Data Visualisation**:
Constructed a variety of different visualisations in the last phase to showcase trends and compare different groups of data.
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning**:
Performed data tidying procedures to reformat datasets for database integration, scanned for missing values, errors and inconsistencies. Split and combined datasets together.
- 📐 **Problem-Solving**:
Strategised creative means to incorporated statistical data into SQL queries for extraction, with statistical data being dependent on neighbouring/grouped data.
- 🔍 **Debugging/Attention to Detail**:
Devoted extensive time to identifying root cause of errors in SQL query outputs. Scrutinised query outputs for incorrect/missing records.
- ⏰ **Time Management**:
Organised weekly schedules and deadlines for individual milestones with leeway for unexpected obstacles both related to and outside of the assessment.
- 🔬 **Research**:
Conducted research on datasets to understand design requirements of the final database schema.
